		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<img id= "tjk" src= "assets/images/TJK.jpg" alt= "Picture of the fabulously handsome Timothy J. King.">
		
		<p>I am Tim, a former educator, aspiring web developer and bear wrestler. I am inspired by both professions, but since web development is slightly less deadly, I am comfortable sticking with that for the time being. I am a recent graduate of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, Java script, React, MySQL, and many more. In addition to coding languages, I learned all necessary aspects of computer science to which have helped me transform into the world class developer, about whom you are currently reading.</p>
