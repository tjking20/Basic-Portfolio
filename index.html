				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<img id= "tjk" src= "assets/images/TJK.jpg" alt= "Picture of the fabulously handsome Timothy J. King.">
				
				<p>I am Tim, a former educator, aspiring web developer and bear wrestler. I am inspired by both professions, but since web development is slightly less deadly, I am comfortable sticking with that for the time being. I am a recent graduate of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, where I learned HTML, CSS, Java script, React, MySQL, and many more. In addition to coding languages, I learned all necessary aspects of computer science to which have helped me transform into the world class developer, about whom you are currently reading. <br> <br>
				Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
